**Speaker Bio:**

Francesco Osborne is a Senior Research Fellow at the Knowledge Media Institute, The Open University (UK), where he leads the [Scholarly Knowledge Mining team](http://skm.kmi.open.ac.uk). He authored more than 120 peer-reviewed publications in the fields of Artificial Intelligence, Information Extraction, Knowledge Graphs, Science of Science, and Research Analytics. His collaborations with leading international publishers have led to innovative intelligence solutions for the analysis of research literature. His work has been recognized with several awards, including the Best In-Use Paper Award at the International Semantic Web Conference 2022. He produced many resources for Open Science, including the [Computer Science Ontology](http://cso.kmi.open.ac.uk), the [CS Knowledge Graph](http://w3id.org/cskg), and the [AIDA Knowledge Graph](http://w3id.org/aida).

**Title:**

Integrating Large Language Models with Scientific Knowledge Graphs: Trends and Future Directions

**Abstract:**

The fast growth of Large Language Models has greatly improved our ability to answer questions based on extensive textual data, but it has also raised crucial concerns regarding the verification and reliability of the information these models provide. This is particularly important in scientific research, where the trustworthiness of information is critical. To tackle these challenges, one effective approach is to incorporate various scientific Knowledge Graphs developed by the research community. This can be done through different methods, including Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), specific knowledge insertion techniques, or by training LLMs to query knowledge graphs. These solutions can improve the performance of Large Language Models across several key tasks, such as responding to scientific inquiries, assisting with literature reviews, extracting information from scholarly articles, generating new knowledge graphs, and formulating research hypotheses. In this talk, I will outline recent advancements in this field and discuss the open challenges.
