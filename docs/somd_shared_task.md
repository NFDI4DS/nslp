**SOMD: Software Mention Detection in Scholarly Publications**

Given the scale and heterogeneity of software citations, robust methods are required to detect and disambiguate mentions of software and related metadata. The Software Mention Detection in Scholarly Publications (SOMD) task will utilise the SoMeSci corpus. We produced novel test data with software mentions and related metadata in articles from multiple research fields. Four subtasks are planned:

**Subtask I: Software mention recognition.** Software mentions shall be recognised from individual sentences. At the same time, software mentions shall be classified according to their mention type, e.g., mention, usage, or creation and the software type, e.g., application, programming environment, or package. and plugin or package. **Subtask II: Additional information.** For each software mention, additional information according to the SoMeSci schema shall be recognised from the sentence. **Subtask III: Relation classification.** For each software mention, relations to other recognised entities shall be classified. This includes versions and developers, but also URLs or host applications for plugins. The evaluation will be based on exact matches rather than partial matches. FScore will be used as a performance metric for all subtasks.

Participants can sign up for one or both subtasks. Automated evaluations of submitted systems are done through the Codalab platform.
