# Submission guidelines

The NSLP 2024 workshop invites submissions of regular long papers, position papers, and short papers presenting negative results, in-progress projects, and demos. We especially encourage submissions from junior researchers and students from diverse backgrounds.

* We will **not accept work that is under review or has already been published** in or accepted for publication in a journal, another conference, or another workshop.
* The workshop invites anonymous submissions of regular **long papers (up to 15 pages)**, position papers, and **short papers (up to 8 pages)** presenting negative results, in-progress projects, and demos. 
* Authors are permitted to include an optional appendix of up to 2 pages. However, reviewers will not be mandated to review the appendix and all papers must be self-contained.
* Reviewing will be performed **double-blind**. Reviewers will not actively try to identify the authors.
* Submissions **must be in PDF**, formatted in the style of the Springer Publications format for **Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS)**. For details on the LNCS style, see Springerâ€™s Author Instructions. 
* The proceedings of this workshop will be published in an Open Access proceedings volume.
* At least **one author per contribution must register** for the conference for presentation.
* Submission is done through [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/account/signin). A link will be provided soon.
